    <h1>Question-16</h1>
    
        <p>How are active links different from normal links?</p>


       <b> Answer:</b>

           <p> Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link; others recognize active links when the link
          has the focus. Those that don't have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link. Some browser recognize active links
          when the mouse cursor is placed over that link.</p>


             <p> An active link is a link that can be clicked on to take you to another page or website. A normal link is a link that can't be
         licked on. But instead provides information about the linked content.</p>
